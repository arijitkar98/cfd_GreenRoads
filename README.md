# GreenRoads #

An app that keeps users safe by suggesting safer routes and giving locality reviews based on crowd-sourced 
flags and ratings from other users. It gives you the option to ping your close friends and family when you 
enter an unsafe location. Based on the frequency of flaggings of localities, it gives out follow-up Q&A's to 
users living around/travelling through those areas.
